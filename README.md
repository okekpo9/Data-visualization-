# Medical Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebook

This project aims to analyze a medical dataset using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The dataset includes various medical parameters such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram result, maximum heart rate achieved, and exercise-induced angina.

## Description

The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the heart dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights related to cardiovascular health. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps are used to analyze the relationships between different variables and predict potential outcomes.

## Features

- Import and preprocess the medical dataset using Pandas.
- Visualize data distributions and relationships using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Explore correlations between variables through scatter plots, heatmaps, and regression analysis.
- Present findings and insights through clear and informative visualizations.

## Installation
